#How to Use
The main functions can run three tests.
 1. Broadcast 4 transactions and monitoring the changes of liquidity pool.
 2. Keep broadcasting transactions and processing
 3. Arbitrage trading with a liquidity pool and an ideal market

These can be run by uncommenting the corresponding line in the main function.

##Target 

This is to implement liquidity pool and make transactions as a toy problem.

- batch style system (blockchain-like)
    - state change for each block
- structures and messages
    - structures to store current AMM states
    - messages for swap, deposit, withdraw
- build a simulator
    - random token pair price generator
    - an arbitrage bot swapping on the AMM
- testing
    - when price get back to original price â†’ pool token balances exactly same as initial balances?
    - what is the relationship between future pool token balances and price change?
        - theoretical vs simulation result
